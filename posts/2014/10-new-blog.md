I've finally made the time to setup my own personal blog. Like many other web developers, I've had my own site for quite sometime. Until now, I've had nothing more than a simple page. But now I am inspired to start writing, thus I've created a blog. Here's how and why.

I think my first page deployed on http://jamespamplin.com was in 2007 with a simple message: "Techno-blog and Site comming soon" - unfortunately no under construction GIFs. Well 7 years later, its time to do something real.

Four and a half years ago, I made the move across the planet from Newcastle in Australia to London, UK. Quitting my job to travel and start afresh turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made. During my time in the UK, I've learned much, and not just about tech. Now, I'd like to try and share what I've learned as much as I can.

Creating my site took longer than I thought, mostly due to laziness, beer, and Netflix. But I'll work towards trying to publish something once a month in the new year.


** And now for the tech... **

In 2012 I decided to give Node JS a try. I quite liked coding in Javascript on the client-side, and wanted to learn more about Node and how Javascript can work on the server-side. My workplace at the time was very conservative with its technology stack (essentially LAMP + Java), so creating a Node service at work wasn't possible.

Like many others, my node initiation was with [Grunt JS](http://gruntjs.com/). Grunt was a great tool for enhancing the build process of Front-end assets. We were using Maven at my workplace at the time for building PHP Web Apps, and using Ant tasks within Maven to process front-end assets was just horrible. Previously, I'd written some shell and PHP scripts to manually concatenate and process front-end assets. Switching to Grunt was fast and simple, and much easier to maintain. Working with Grunt vastly improved our front-end asset workflow. I was intrigued by Node JS's simplicity and speed, and wanted to experiment using it for server-side applications, thus I started to create a new personal website in Node.
