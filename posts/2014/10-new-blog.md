I've finally made the time to setup my own personal blog. Like many other web developers, I've had my own site for quite sometime. Until now, I've had nothing more than a simple page. But now I am inspired to start writing, thus I've created a blog. Here's how and why.

I think my first page deployed on http://jamespamplin.com was in 2007 with a simple message: "Techno-blog and Site comming soon" - unfortunately no under construction GIFs. Well 7 years later, its time to do something real.

Four and a half years ago, I made the move across the planet from Newcastle in Australia to London, UK. Quitting my job to travel and start afresh turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made. During my time in the UK, I've learned much.

** And now for the tech... **

In 2012 I decided to give Node JS a try. I quite liked coding in Javascript on the client-side, and wanted to learn more about Node and how Javascript can work on the server-side. [Grunt JS](http://gruntjs.com/)

Node site on heroku.

Microdata, Schema.org

Docker on CoreOS. Hosted on [Digital Ocean](http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=c0a34dd866c3).
