I've finally made the time to setup my own personal blog. Here's how and why.

Like many other web developers, I've had my own site for quite sometime. I think my first page deployed on http://jamespamplin.com was in 2007,

"Techno-blog and Site comming soon" - unfortunately no under construction GIFs.


Node site on heroku.

Docker on CoreOS. Hosted on [Digital Ocean](http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=c0a34dd866c3).
